<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

if u, v, w are independent, any vector can be produced form cu + dv + ew
the cases of u, v, w are dependent:
+ u, w, w are in the same linear: if any vectors are not on the line, they can't be produced from cu + dv + ew
+ u,v,w are in the same plane:  if any vectors are not in uvw plane, they can't be produced from cu + dv + ew
